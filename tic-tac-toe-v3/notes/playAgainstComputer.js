  // tictactoe() calls module, method or function in computerPlayer()
  // computerPlayer() imports module tictactoe as 'game'

      // initiate computer player 'waiting' for game.isTurn

      // each turn
        // tictactoe() passes updated
          // Xfilled array, filledBoxes array and winRow to computerPlayer()

      // when computer player is "thinking",
        // o-svg appears to hover over several of the empty boxes

      // need to detail rules, logic for computerPlayer() to choose best move

      // computer player selects a box, uses game.playgame or similar code to
        // place fill selected box with o.svg

      // computerPlayer() set game.isTurn back to "playerX"
      // computerPlayer passed updated arrays, object back to tictactoe()
          // i.e, Xfilled array, filledBoxes array and winRow
