# TD-Project4: TIC-TAC-TOE

# Project Expectations:  Completed:

    No plugins are used. Besides the html and provided css and svg images, all javascript, game.js, is written by me. I modified index.html a little and added a game.css as well.

    Game begin

        When the page loads, the startup screen appears.
        When the player clicks the start button the start screen disappears, the board appears, and the game begins.
        The game starts with X, and the X player box is highlighted to indicate this.

    Game play:

        The game play following these rules:

        Play alternates between X and O.

        The current player is indicated at the top of the page -- the box with the symbol O or X is highlighted for the current player.

        When the current player mouses over an empty square on the board, it's symbol the X or O should appear on the square.

        Players can only click on empty squares. When the player clicks on an empty square the proper image to the square marking it as occupied.

        Once a box is chosen, or clicked, the players turn ends and the other players turn begins. There is no opportunity to go back and deselect a box or do a turn over again.

        The game ends when one player has three of their symbols in a row either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

        If all of the squares are filled and no players have three in a row, the game is a tie.

        When the game ends, the board disappears and the game end screen appears.

  Game end:

        The word "Winner" appears and the screen is the players color, Blue for X and Orange for O.

        If it's tie, no winner, the screen is green and the phrase "It's a tie" appears.

        When a player pushes the "New Game" button, the board appears again, empty, and a new game begins.

# Extra Credit TO DO:

    To get an "exceeds" rating, you can expand on the project in the following ways:

    4 steps

# DONE: On the start screen, prompt the user add their name before the game starts

# DONE Display the player’s name on the board screen during game play

# IN PROGRESS Add programming to support playing against the computer. Only one player plays; the other is controlled by your programming.

# DONE: Display the player’s name if they win the game
